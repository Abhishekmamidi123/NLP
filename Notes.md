## Notes
- Use Stacked LSTM, if necessary to get good results instead of LSTM.
- LSTM + CNN - CNN on top of LSTM
  - LSTM is used for feature extraction and CNN is used to interpret the features accross the time steps.
- In Keras - Types of predictions:
  - model.predict(X)
  - model.predict_classes(X)
  - model.predict_proba(X)
- ### Life cycle for LSTM models in Keras
  - Define Network
    - Input must be three dimensional - samples, timesteps, features.
    - Convert 2D dataset into 3D dataset.
    - input_shape argument expects a tuple - (number of timesteps, number of features)
    - Some of the standard activation functions that can be used in the output layer:
      - Regression - 'linear'
      - Binary Classification(2 classes) - 'sigmoid'
      - Multiclass Classification(>2 classes) - 'softmax'
    - Example:
      - model = Sequential()
      - model.add(LSTM(5, input_shape=(2,1)))
      - model.add(Dense(1))
      - model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
      
  - Compile Network
    - It transforms the simple sequence of layers that we defined into a highly efficient series of matrix transforms in a format intended to be executed on your GPU or CPU, depending on how Keras is configured.
    - Example:
      - model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    - Some of the standard loss functions that can be used in the output layer:
      - Regression - 'mean_squared_error'
      - Binary Classification(2 classes) - 'binary_crossentropy' or cross entropy
      - Multiclass Classification(>2 classes) - 'categorical_crossentropy' or Multiclass Logarithmic Loss
    - Some of the optimization algorithms:
      - Stochastic Gradient Descent - 'sgd'
      - Adam - 'adam'
      - RMSprop - 'rmsprop'
    - Metrics: ['accuracy']
  - Fit Network
    - X, y, batch size and epochs are some of the parameters.
    - Example:
      - model.fit(X, y, batch_size=10, epochs=100, verbose=0)
  - Evaluate Network
    - Evaluating the trained model.
    - loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
  - Make Predictions
    - Make predictions on new data
    - predictions = model.predict(X)
- ### Different types of Sequence Prediction Problems:
  - Sequence Prediction:
    - Given a sequence of values, predicting the next value.
  - Sequence Classification:
    - Predicting a class label for a given input sequence.
  - Sequence Genration:
    - Generating a sequence - Text generation, Music generation.
  - Sequence to Sequence Prediction:
    - Predicts an output sequence, given an input sequence.
